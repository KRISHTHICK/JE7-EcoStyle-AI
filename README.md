## 👟 **EcoStyle AI – Sustainable Fashion Advisor**

### 🚀 Project Overview

**EcoStyle AI** is an AI-powered assistant that helps users make **eco-conscious fashion choices**. It recommends sustainable outfits, educates users about clothing materials, rates the carbon footprint of garments, and helps upcycle existing wardrobe items. It supports image uploads, natural language queries, and integrates with Ollama (LLMs), Python, and Streamlit.

---

### 🌟 Key Features

1. **♻️ Sustainability Scanner**
   Upload a clothing item image or describe it in text. The AI analyzes the material and design to provide:

   * Sustainability score (1–10)
   * Environmental impact tips
   * Recyclability and upcycling suggestions

2. **👕 Eco-Friendly Outfit Suggestions**
   Get outfit combinations based on your existing wardrobe that are both stylish and eco-friendly.

3. **🛍️ Ethical Brand Recommender**
   Suggests brands and stores that follow sustainable and fair-trade practices based on your preferences.

4. **📦 Closet Upcycler AI Agent**
   Upload old clothes' images, and it generates ideas to reuse, restyle, or donate them.

5. **🧠 Ask the EcoStyle Assistant**
   Use a chat-based interface powered by **Ollama (LLMs)** to ask questions like:

   * "Is organic cotton better than recycled polyester?"
   * "Suggest an outfit for summer that’s climate-friendly"

---

### 🧠 Tech Stack

* **Frontend/UI**: Streamlit
* **Backend AI**: Ollama LLM (`tinyllama` or `mistral`)
* **Image Processing**: `PIL`, `transformers`, `timm`, etc.
* **LLM Tools**: `langchain`, `RetrievalQA`, `FAISS`
* **Deployment**: GitHub + VS Code

### 📦 Code Example: Main App (Summary)

```python
# app.py
import streamlit as st
from PIL import Image
from modules.eco_assessment import assess_sustainability
from modules.upcycle_agent import suggest_upcycle_ideas
from langchain.llms import Ollama
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings

st.set_page_config(page_title="EcoStyle AI", layout="wide")
st.title("♻️ EcoStyle AI – Sustainable Fashion Advisor")

uploaded = st.file_uploader("Upload Clothing Image", type=["jpg", "png", "jpeg"])
if uploaded:
    img = Image.open(uploaded)
    st.image(img, use_column_width=True)
    
    sustainability_score, material_info = assess_sustainability(img)
    st.metric("Sustainability Score", f"{sustainability_score}/10")
    st.write("**Material Info**:", material_info)

    st.divider()
    st.subheader("♻️ Upcycle Ideas")
    ideas = suggest_upcycle_ideas(img)
    st.write(ideas)

st.divider()
st.subheader("🧠 Ask EcoStyle AI")
query = st.chat_input("Ask about fashion sustainability...")
if query:
    # You’d load a vector store and LLM here
    llm = Ollama(model="tinyllama")
    embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
    retriever = FAISS.load_local("faiss_store", embeddings).as_retriever()
    qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, retriever=retriever)
    answer = qa_chain.run(query)
    st.markdown(answer)
```

### ✅ How to Run (Locally or GitHub)

#### Run in VS Code:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

#### GitHub Steps:

1. Push to GitHub
2. Create `README.md`
3. Optionally add `streamlit_app` branch for public Streamlit deployment
4. Deploy via Streamlit Cloud or HuggingFace Spaces (not GitHub Pages, since it’s not static)

Would you like me to generate:

* Full `README.md`?
* The content of `eco_assessment.py` and `upcycle_agent.py`?
* Or a zip of the whole app?

Let me know how you’d like to proceed!
